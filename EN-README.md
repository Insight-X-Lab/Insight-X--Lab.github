## 🎯 About Us

**Insight X Lab** is focusing on the deep integration of psychology and artificial intelligence. Based on our original **Human-Centered World Model**, we have conducted cutting-edge research in areas such as affective computing, natural language processing, intelligent interaction, and multimodal integration. We are committed to promoting innovative applications of AI in fields such as mental health and human-computer interaction. Our goal is to enable AI to understand the human mind and use AI to create a better world.

## 🔬 Research Direction

The research institute focuses on three core research directions at the intersection of psychology and artificial intelligence, forming a complete scientific research system from basic research to applied transformation:

| Research Direction | Core Areas | Key Technology | Application Scenarios |
|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Affective Computing** | PAD Emotion Recognition | Grounded in the PAD emotional theory (Mehrabian & Russell, 1974), the team, has combined cutting-edge **Vision Transformer technology with proprietary optimization algorithms** to develop an efficient and precise emotion regression-classification hybrid model—the Lianxin PAD Emotional Recognition Model. This model successfully overcomes the flat limitations of traditional emotion recognition, achieving a correlation with human annotations of **0.91, 0.85, and 0.89** for Pleasure (P), Arousal (A), and Dominance (D), respectively, which has reached a level comparable to expert judgment in PAD emotion assessment and allowed for accurate detection of subtle emotional variations. The server-side high-frequency inference latency is controlled within 45ms, with complete API response time at 233ms, significantly enhancing robustness in complex environments. The model also supports the quantification and identification of the semantic taxonomy of 8 basic emotions and 9 categories of emotions with specified valence, establishing industry-leading reliability in emotion quantification. | Educational scenarios, Public security/Judicial scenarios, and Corporate employee management |
| **Personality Analysis** | Big Five Personality Analysis | In order to overcome the subjective bias and efficiency limitations of traditional self-report inventory, we have proposed a research path of "de-scaling but not de-theorizing", aiming to objectively infer the stable personality traits of individuals from their explicit behavior, based on the Big Five personality model. We have pioneered the dual-engine architecture of "CMA-ViT Cross-Modal Attention Vision Transformer" and "STOR-RAG Personality Recognition Workflow (Scale to Observable Representations, STOR)", so as to achieve full-chain analysis from feature perception to trait inference. <ul><li><strong>CMA-ViT Model</strong>: This model focuses on capturing high-granularity explicit visual features. The model is based on the CNN-Transformer hybrid encoder, which innovatively integrates **high-order faical expression extraction technology and TimeSformer**. It can model subtle, instantaneous dynamic patterns from facial video sequences and encode them into behavioral representations related to personality traits. </li><li><strong>STOR-RAG Workflow</strong>: The STOR-RAG workflow focuses on transparent reasoning of implicit personality constructs. Its core innovation is transforming psychological theories, such as the Big Five Personality Scale entries, into knowledge base of observable behavioral indicators. When performing the evaluation, the model retrieves relevant theoretical evidence from the knowledge base for chain reasoning based on the features extracted from the input. Therefore, it can generate a personality assessment report that is not only accurate (70% accuracy of the public dataset), but also traceable in the process and interpretable in conclusions. The scheme promotes personality assessment from black-box scoring to white-box psychological reasoning, and the test-retest reliability is as high as 0.9, which significantly improves the credibility and practicability of computational psychology applications. | Recruitment screening, Educational interventions, Psychological counseling, Judicial assessment, and Human-computer interaction |
| **Psychological Risk Assessment** | Mental Health | The team relies on its independently developed **China's first nationally registered psychological large model — Dongjianrenhe (洞见人和)** and has innovatively launched a depression tendency recognition model based on **facial action unit recognition and deep convolutional neural network technology**, providing a reliable tool for non-invasive psychological screening. This depression tendency recognition model shows strong adaptability and accuracy across different scenarios. In a frontal view scenario, a depression risk assessment can be completed with just a 15-second front-facing video. After extensive data training, the accuracy of the depression tendency recognition model currently **remains stable above 80%, reaching up to 89%**, leading the industry. In high-angle camera scenarios, the model establishes an individual 'emotional baseline' to achieve long-term dynamic monitoring and personalized risk assessment. In pilot projects conducted with schools, the consistency between the recognition results and teachers' observations reached as high as 83%. | Campus safety and security, Judicial correction, and Corporate talent management |
